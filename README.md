

This project is what I am currently working on. It is working and playable.
The game is written in Java and utilizes only the Swing and Runnable libraries, while the rest of the code is implemented as objects.
I am trying to write clear, simple, and functional code. This project is a tower defense game with simple graphics that I created using Asprite and Paint.

It has been some time, and with the recent updates, you can notice a difference.

Here is a short video demonstrating how the game works.
